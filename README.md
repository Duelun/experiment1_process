I am make experiments to prove my Dual Element Universe theory. To this, I designed an electronic twin-board device. The device can take five different type electrical impulses on five channels at the exactly same time on twin-panels. By doing so, I can determine the difference between the fload rate of time in two different spatial locations and hopefully prove the existence of the ether.
The device directed by a Rapsberry Pi 4 micro-computer.  [This script](https://github.com/duelun/experiment1_save/blob/main) runs on Raspberry Pi 4 and handle the device and saves the measurement datas.

The presented script can handle the saved datas.

The script was published to check the correctness of the measurement methodology.

# The operation of the script:
 - It opens data file.
 - Structure the loaded datas into arrays.
 - Handle the datas as a cohesive package by measured oscillation of electrick sign in one period, the time of measure and the measured temperatures.
 - We can draw datas as graf into windows and/or print data values into table.
 - We can manipulate grafs by custom functions, compare two graf to each other.
 - We can add, extract, multiple etc. or process custom function on a graf or on two grafs related to each other.
 - We can take picture from any window.
 - Can save back the manipulated arrays into file.

# The abilities of script:
 - Load, save by basic way.
 - Delete graf one by one or in group.
 - Set window number and size.
 - Set graf number in each one window.
 - Change time frame of datas.
 - Manipulate datas by custom functions. A custom function need write into file and after it selectable in drop-down menu. A function can has maximum six parameter. /can increased by programming/
 - Move on x and y axis, shift, zoom, sincronising a graf or a graf group in the window.
 - Setable resolution and timeframe of grafs.
 - To take picture from windows.
